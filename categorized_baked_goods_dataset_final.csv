▢1/2 cup + 2 tbsp (120 g) light brown sugar
▢1/3 cup + 2 tbsp (110 mL) vegetable or sunflower oil
▢4 tbsp non-dairy milk (such as almond, oat, rice or soy milk)
▢1/2 tsp vanilla paste (I love vanilla bean paste because it gives a very intense flavour and you only need a small amount, but you can also use 1 - 2 tsp vanilla extract)
▢1 3/4 cups + 1 tbsp (220 g) plain all-purpose flour
▢1 tsp baking powder
▢1/2 tsp baking soda
▢pinch of salt
▢3 1/2 oz (100 g) dark chocolate chips, chunks, wafers or chopped dark chocolate (I love Guittard's 64% and 72% chocolate wafers, as they give wonderful pools of melted chocolate – you can use either, depending on how bitter-sweet you like your chocolate)",350 F,"In a bowl, whisk together the sugars, oil, non-dairy milk and vanilla.
Sift in the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Mix well until you get a smooth cookie dough with no flour clumps (shouldn't be sticky to the touch).
Add in most of the chocolate (set some aside for adding on top of cookies during baking) and mix well until evenly distributed.
Scoop the cookie dough using an ice cream or cookie scoop. Refrigerate the scoops of cookie dough for at least 1 hour or overnight (in a closed container).
Pre-heat the oven to 355 ºF (180 ºC) and line a baking sheet with baking/greaseproof paper.
Place the scoops of cookie dough onto the lined baking sheet, with at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) between them, as they will spread during baking.
Bake the cookies at 355 ºF (180 ºC) for 10 to 12 minutes. This gives the perfect balance between crispy edges and a gooey/fudgy middle.
The banging makes the cookies flatter, and gives them that characteristic crackly appearance, while adding more chocolate on top ensures they come out of the oven with GLORIOUS pools of melted chocolate.
